This is a responsive portfolio website created using HTML, CSS, SASS, and a touch of JavaScript.

## Description
The project is organized into sections, and the CSS styles are written using Sass/Scss and divided into the `scss` folder.

Several packages from the jQuery library, such as type-writer, owl.carousel, lightbox.min, are included in the project. They are placed in the `js` and `css` folders.

In addition, the JavaScript code in `counter.js` is responsible for triggering the counter in the `#home__counter/Section` section when it becomes visible on the page. This is achieved by using the "Intersection Observer API" and incrementing the counter.

The `index.html` page includes the type-writer and `counter.js` scripts, as well as the jQuery library, to enable the "scroll-to-top" functionality.
